# Homework 3
Consider a ideal monoatomic gas $\left(C_p = \frac{3}{2} R\right)$ sealed in a piston that undergoes a thermodynamic cycle. The initial state of the system (state 1) has a volume of 1.00 L, a pressure of 10.0 atm and  temperature of 600 K. The piston and gas is considered to be a closed system (i.e. no leaks) and for the purposes of this homework the piston does not have a maximum volume and is frictionless. The system then undergoes the following "steps" all of which can be considered to be reversible:

* Starting in state 1, the gas expands isothermally to a pressure of 5.00 atm resulting in state 2.
* The gas then experiences an adiabatic expansion to a temperature of 300 K resulting in state 3.
* The gas then experiences an isothermal compression to 10.0 liters resulting in state 4.
* Finally, the gas experiences an adiabatic compression back to state 1, completing the cycle. 

Fill in the following table that summarizes the different states present throughout the cycle.

Fill in the following table that summarizes the different "steps" (paths) present throughout the cycle.

| 1 $\rightarrow$ 2 |                 |                 |                 |
| 2 $\rightarrow$ 3 |                 |                 |                 |
| 3 $\rightarrow$ 4 |                 |                 |                 |
| 4 $\rightarrow$ 1 |                 |                 |                 |

Sketch a PV plot of the different states and the paths connecting them. The isotherms will also need to be distinguished/indicated in some manner, state 1 is already on the plot. When connecting each state via a path, please remember that they are not linear relationships and your sketch should reflect (within reason, the room on the graph is limited).
