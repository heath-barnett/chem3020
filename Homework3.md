1. Consider a perfect gas sealed in a piston that undergoes the Carnot cycle. The initial state of the system (state 1) has a volume of 5.00 L, a pressure of 10.0 atm and  temperature of 600 K. The piston and gas is considered to be a closed system (i.e. no leaks). The system then undergoes the following "steps": 

* The gas expands isothermally to a pressure of 1.00 atm (state 2).
* The gas then experiences an adiabatic expansion to a temperature of 300 K (state 3).
* The gas then experiences an isothermal compression (state 4).
* Finally, the gas experiences an adiabatic compression back to state 1. 

Determine the values of q, w, )U, )H, )S and )Stot for each stage of the cycle and for the
cycle as a whole. Express your answer as a table of values
