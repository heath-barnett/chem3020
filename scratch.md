Answer the following questions about the cycle,
* Calculate the efficiency of this engine.
* Suppose that this theoretical engine is used as the engine on a rocket ship (some engineer figured out how to convert  our engines output energy into thrust). The rocket ship's total mass is 1000 kg (this includes the engine and fuel). We decided to use octane ($C_8H_{18}$) for the generation of heat. The enthalpy of combustion of octane is $\Delta H_{comb}= -5512 \frac{kJ}{mol}. If you were to load this rocket ship 1 gallon of pure octane ($\approx$ 3 kg). What is the maximum height, neglecting all forms of friction, to which our rocket ship can be flown straight up from earth. Gravitational potential energy at the surface of the earth can be defined with $ P_{eg}= mgh$. During flight the engine cylinder temperature is 2000°C and the exit temperature is 800°C. You may also ignore the loss of mass from fuel combustion during flight.
